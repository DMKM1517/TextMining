Brill Tagger Paper Summary

Its a POS tagger
Advantages
	Reduction in Storage Information
	Small and Meaningful rules
	Better portability to use on different data sets
	It automatically learns the rules

POS Taggers uses Markovs model
	They caputure lexical and contextual info
	1) Paramteters are estimated
	2) sentences are tagged with the probability score

Rule based Taggers
	Have higher error rates than POS
	Rule based tagger with knowledge of syntax = stochastic tagger

This paper is about rule based tagger
	Based on probabilistic models
